Dawn was quickly approaching, and only the slightest amount of townsfolk were coming around. \
As the sun rose over the distant horizon, the first villagers ventured out of the safety of their homes.  
Soon enough, a dog began to bark. Its owner quickly came over to calm it down. The dog did not stop, \
and walked towards a corner. The tall animal came to a halt, and beckoned its owner to come. \
The owner was appalled by the sight. The brick walls were imbued with the dark stain of blood, \
and a decapitated head was at the base.  
A few paces away, a foot was found. Forty feet later, another foot and a hand was found. \
The man who had discovered the dismembered corpse acknowledged the presence of a particular smell, \
much like that of a wolf that occasionally prowled along the edges of the forests. \
An autopsy done by the town surgeon revealed a wolf tooth ingrained within the skull. \
The corpse was revealed to be of one {0}.'''.format(victims[0])
