The sound of a whistling kettle broke the dawn for [0]'s neighbour as they prepared their morning pick-me-up coffee. To their discontent, the cofee tin had naught but a bean left.
*"Rats thumbs are afoot," the neighbour shouted, and wrathfully stumbled outside to their neighbour [0].* After banging on the door with no luck, the neighbour attempted to open the door. The morning sun shined a beam of light into the room as the door creaked open. Out of the shadow a bloody hand, beloning to [0], was revealed.
The bag of coffeee had been soiled by the dark acts that transpired that night.
