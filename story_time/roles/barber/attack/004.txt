Later that day, another body was found! Were they too careless, and did they miss that one body?
No, it seems like this one was new. The flesh was still warm, and the cuts in [0]'s neck did not have much blood yet; The murder must've left a few minutes ago!
In other parts of the town, people noticed that [0], the town's favourite barber, had a lot of blood stains on their hands and clothes...
**[owner], a barber, has killed [0] and turned into an Innocent!**
