The Wild West used to have some strange rules! Stealing a horse had the penalty of death, whereas killing an opponent in a deadly duel was completely fine! However, as [0] was to find out today, those rules were not strange **at all** compared to this town's.
[owner], a happy barber, had a pretty good conversation with one of their clients, [0]. However, [0] appeared to lose a lot of hair, hair which strangely resembled that of the hair found on the town's dead bodies...
The barber knew what to do, *accidentally* slit their knife in the wrong direction, and beheaded their client.
[owner], realising what the consequences would be, prepared themselves for a long time in jail. They were ready to get lynched that day, but found out neither was bound to happen!
Apparently, this town had an extraordinary rule. Going to the barber made the barber responsible of your life. Not their fault if you die.
After this day, however, no-one dared to visit [owner]'s barbershop anymore, forcing them to close for good.
**<@{}>, a barber, has assassinated [0] and has become an **Innocent!**
